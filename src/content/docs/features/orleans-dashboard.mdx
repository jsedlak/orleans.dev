The **Orleans Dashboard** is a community-maintained web-based monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into your Orleans cluster. It shows silo status, grain activations, method call statistics, and more — all through a browser-based UI.

## Setup

### Install the Package

```bash
dotnet add package OrleansDashboard
```

### Configure the Silo

```csharp
siloBuilder.UseDashboard(options =>
{
    options.Port = 8080;
    options.Host = "*";
});
```

The dashboard is now accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Port` | `8080` | The port the dashboard web server listens on. |
| `Host` | `"*"` | The host to bind to. |
| `BasePath` | `"/"` | Base URL path for the dashboard. |
| `CounterUpdateIntervalMs` | `1000` | How often to refresh statistics (milliseconds). |
| `HideTrace` | `false` | Hide the trace/log viewer. |

## Co-Hosting with ASP.NET Core

When Orleans is hosted alongside ASP.NET Core, you can embed the dashboard into the existing web application instead of running a separate server:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.UseOrleans(siloBuilder =>
{
    siloBuilder.UseDashboard();
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.Map("/dashboard", x => x.UseOrleansDashboard());

app.Run();
```

This makes the dashboard available at `/dashboard` on the same port as your web application.

## Dashboard Features

### Cluster Overview

- **Silo status** — see all silos in the cluster, their status (active, joining, dead), and uptime.
- **Total activations** — aggregate count of grain activations across the cluster.
- **Message throughput** — messages sent and received per second.

### Grain Statistics

- **Activations by type** — breakdown of active grains by grain type.
- **Top grains** — most active grains ranked by message count.
- **Grain method calls** — per-method call counts, success rates, and average latency.

### Silo Details

- **Per-silo metrics** — CPU, memory, activation count, and message rates for each silo.
- **Silo history** — track when silos joined or left the cluster.

### Reminders

- **Active reminders** — view all registered reminders, their periods, and next fire times.

### Log Streaming

- **Live logs** — stream silo logs in real time through the dashboard UI.

<Aside type="caution">
  The dashboard adds overhead by collecting statistics from all silos. In high-throughput production environments, consider using [OpenTelemetry-based metrics](/features/metrics-and-monitoring/) instead for lower overhead, and reserve the dashboard for development or staging.
</Aside>

## Securing the Dashboard

In production, secure the dashboard behind authentication:

```csharp
app.Map("/dashboard", dashboardApp =>
{
    dashboardApp.UseAuthentication();
    dashboardApp.UseAuthorization();
    dashboardApp.UseOrleansDashboard();
}).RequireAuthorization("AdminOnly");
```

Or restrict access by network:

```csharp
siloBuilder.UseDashboard(options =>
{
    options.Host = "127.0.0.1"; // Only accessible locally
});
```
