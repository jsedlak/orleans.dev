Orleans provides a rich set of features for building distributed, scalable applications using the virtual actor model. Explore the major capabilities below.

## Core Programming Model

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Grains (Virtual Actors)" icon="seti:csharp">
    The fundamental building block of Orleans. Grains are isolated, single-threaded units of state and logic with stable identities — automatically activated on demand and deactivated when idle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Persistence" icon="pencil">
    Declarative state management that transparently loads and saves grain state to pluggable storage backends. Supports multiple named states per grain.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Identity & Lifecycle" icon="setting">
    Each grain has a unique, stable identity (GUID, integer, or string key). Orleans manages activation, deactivation, and garbage collection automatically — no manual lifecycle code required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turn-Based Concurrency" icon="random">
    Grains process messages one at a time by default, eliminating races and deadlocks without explicit locks. Reentrancy can be opted into when needed.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Communication & Messaging

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Streaming" icon="right-arrow">
    Build reactive, event-driven pipelines with Orleans Streams. Supports implicit and explicit subscriptions, multiple stream providers, and backpressure.
    [Learn more](/features/streaming/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observers" icon="open-book">
    Enable pub/sub notification patterns where grains push updates to connected clients or other grains without polling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request/Response & One-Way" icon="document">
    Strongly-typed grain interfaces with async request/response calls. One-way fire-and-forget messages are also supported for scenarios that don't need a response.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Scheduling & Timers

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Timers" icon="setting">
    Lightweight, in-memory periodic callbacks tied to the grain's activation lifecycle. Ideal for short-lived recurring work within a single grain.
    [Learn more](/features/timers-and-reminders/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reminders" icon="setting">
    Persistent, durable scheduled callbacks that survive grain deactivations and silo restarts. Use reminders when you need guaranteed periodic execution.
    [Learn more](/features/timers-and-reminders/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Cluster Management

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Silo Clustering" icon="puzzle">
    Automatic cluster membership, failure detection, and silo discovery using pluggable providers (Azure Table, Redis, SQL, Consul, ZooKeeper, and more).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Directory" icon="document">
    A distributed directory that maps grain identities to their physical locations in the cluster, enabling transparent location-aware routing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Heterogeneous Silos" icon="setting">
    Run different grain types on different silos within the same cluster, allowing you to tailor hardware and resources to specific workloads.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Reliability & Transactions

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="ACID Transactions" icon="pencil">
    Coordinate multi-grain operations with distributed ACID transactions — ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability across grains and storage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reentrancy & Error Handling" icon="random">
    Fine-grained control over reentrancy behavior with `[Reentrant]` and `[AlwaysInterleave]` attributes. Exceptions propagate naturally across async grain calls.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Integration & Extensibility

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="ASP.NET Core Co-Hosting" icon="puzzle">
    Host Orleans silos alongside ASP.NET Core applications in a single process, sharing the same dependency injection container and configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pluggable Providers" icon="setting">
    Swap storage, clustering, streaming, reminders, and grain directory backends without changing application code. See the full list of [available integrations](/integrations/).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Placement Strategies" icon="random">
    Control where grains are activated in the cluster — random, local, hash-based, activation-count-based, or implement your own custom placement strategy.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
