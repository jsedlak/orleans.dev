import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Orleans provides a rich set of features for building distributed, scalable applications using the virtual actor model. Explore the major capabilities below.

## Core Programming Model

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Grains (Virtual Actors)" icon="seti:csharp">
    The fundamental building block of Orleans. Grains are isolated, single-threaded units of state and logic with stable identities — automatically activated on demand and deactivated when idle.
    [Learn more](/features/grains/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Persistence" icon="pencil">
    Declarative state management that transparently loads and saves grain state to pluggable storage backends. Supports multiple named states per grain.
    [Learn more](/features/grain-persistence/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Identity & Lifecycle" icon="setting">
    Each grain has a unique, stable identity (GUID, integer, or string key). Orleans manages activation, deactivation, and garbage collection automatically — no manual lifecycle code required.
    [Learn more](/features/grain-identity-and-lifecycle/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turn-Based Concurrency" icon="random">
    Grains process messages one at a time by default, eliminating races and deadlocks without explicit locks. Reentrancy can be opted into when needed.
    [Learn more](/features/turn-based-concurrency/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stateless Worker Grains" icon="rocket">
    Grains marked with `[StatelessWorker]` allow multiple activations across silos, execute locally to avoid network hops, and auto-scale their activation pool based on load.
    [Learn more](/features/stateless-worker-grains/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Extensions" icon="puzzle">
    Add new functionality to grains at runtime by implementing `IGrainExtension`. Extensions are injected via dependency injection without modifying the original grain class.
    [Learn more](/features/grain-extensions/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Communication & Messaging

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Streaming" icon="right-arrow">
    Build reactive, event-driven pipelines with Orleans Streams. Supports implicit and explicit subscriptions, multiple stream providers, and backpressure.
    [Learn more](/features/streaming/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observers" icon="open-book">
    Enable pub/sub notification patterns where grains push updates to connected clients or other grains without polling.
    [Learn more](/features/observers/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request/Response & One-Way" icon="document">
    Strongly-typed grain interfaces with async request/response calls. One-way fire-and-forget messages are also supported for scenarios that don't need a response.
    [Learn more](/features/request-response-and-one-way/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request Context" icon="add-document">
    Flow application metadata — trace IDs, correlation tokens, and custom values — automatically with Orleans requests across grain calls using async-local storage.
    [Learn more](/features/request-context/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cancellation Tokens" icon="setting">
    Pass standard `CancellationToken` parameters on grain methods to enable cooperative cancellation of long-running operations, with automatic timeout-based cancellation support.
    [Learn more](/features/cancellation-tokens/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Scheduling & Timers

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Timers" icon="setting">
    Lightweight, in-memory periodic callbacks tied to the grain's activation lifecycle. Ideal for short-lived recurring work within a single grain.
    [Learn more](/features/timers-and-reminders/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reminders" icon="setting">
    Persistent, durable scheduled callbacks that survive grain deactivations and silo restarts. Use reminders when you need guaranteed periodic execution.
    [Learn more](/features/timers-and-reminders/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Event Sourcing

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Journaled Grains" icon="pencil">
    Derive from `JournaledGrain` to model state as the result of applying a sequence of events. Supports atomic multi-event raises, tentative vs. confirmed state, and version tracking.
    [Learn more](/features/journaled-grains/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Log-Consistency Providers" icon="setting">
    Three built-in providers — State Storage (snapshots), Log Storage (event logs), and Custom Storage — with support for replicated grain instances across clusters.
    [Learn more](/features/log-consistency-providers/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Cluster Management

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Silo Clustering" icon="puzzle">

    [Learn more](/features/silo-clustering/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Directory" icon="document">
    A distributed directory that maps grain identities to their physical locations in the cluster, enabling transparent location-aware routing.
    [Learn more](/features/grain-directory/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Heterogeneous Silos" icon="setting">
    Run different grain types on different silos within the same cluster, allowing you to tailor hardware and resources to specific workloads.
    [Learn more](/features/heterogeneous-silos/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Migration" icon="right-arrow">
    Migrate grains between silos without losing state via dehydration and rehydration. Grains implement `IGrainMigrationParticipant` to participate in the migration process.

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Reliability & Transactions

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="ACID Transactions" icon="pencil">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Reentrancy & Request Scheduling" icon="random">
    Fine-grained control over concurrency with `[Reentrant]`, `[AlwaysInterleave]`, `[ReadOnly]`, and `[MayInterleave]` attributes. Call chain reentrancy scopes for advanced scenarios.
    [Learn more](/features/reentrancy-and-request-scheduling/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Load Shedding" icon="setting">

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Serialization & Code Generation

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Serialization Framework" icon="seti:json">
