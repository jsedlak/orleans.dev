Orleans provides a rich set of features for building distributed, scalable applications using the virtual actor model. Explore the major capabilities below.

## Core Programming Model

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Grains (Virtual Actors)" icon="seti:csharp">
    The fundamental building block of Orleans. Grains are isolated, single-threaded units of state and logic with stable identities — automatically activated on demand and deactivated when idle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Persistence" icon="pencil">
    Declarative state management that transparently loads and saves grain state to pluggable storage backends. Supports multiple named states per grain.
    [Learn more](/features/grain-persistence/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Identity & Lifecycle" icon="setting">
    Each grain has a unique, stable identity (GUID, integer, or string key). Orleans manages activation, deactivation, and garbage collection automatically — no manual lifecycle code required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Turn-Based Concurrency" icon="random">
    Grains process messages one at a time by default, eliminating races and deadlocks without explicit locks. Reentrancy can be opted into when needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stateless Worker Grains" icon="rocket">
    Grains marked with `[StatelessWorker]` allow multiple activations across silos, execute locally to avoid network hops, and auto-scale their activation pool based on load.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Extensions" icon="puzzle">
    Add new functionality to grains at runtime by implementing `IGrainExtension`. Extensions are injected via dependency injection without modifying the original grain class.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Communication & Messaging

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Streaming" icon="right-arrow">
    Build reactive, event-driven pipelines with Orleans Streams. Supports implicit and explicit subscriptions, multiple stream providers, and backpressure.
    [Learn more](/features/streaming/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observers" icon="open-book">
    Enable pub/sub notification patterns where grains push updates to connected clients or other grains without polling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request/Response & One-Way" icon="document">
    Strongly-typed grain interfaces with async request/response calls. One-way fire-and-forget messages are also supported for scenarios that don't need a response.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request Context" icon="add-document">
    Flow application metadata — trace IDs, correlation tokens, and custom values — automatically with Orleans requests across grain calls using async-local storage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cancellation Tokens" icon="setting">
    Pass standard `CancellationToken` parameters on grain methods to enable cooperative cancellation of long-running operations, with automatic timeout-based cancellation support.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Scheduling & Timers

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Timers" icon="setting">
    Lightweight, in-memory periodic callbacks tied to the grain's activation lifecycle. Ideal for short-lived recurring work within a single grain.
    [Learn more](/features/timers-and-reminders/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reminders" icon="setting">
    Persistent, durable scheduled callbacks that survive grain deactivations and silo restarts. Use reminders when you need guaranteed periodic execution.
    [Learn more](/features/timers-and-reminders/)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Event Sourcing

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Journaled Grains" icon="pencil">
    Derive from `JournaledGrain` to model state as the result of applying a sequence of events. Supports atomic multi-event raises, tentative vs. confirmed state, and version tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Log-Consistency Providers" icon="setting">
    Three built-in providers — State Storage (snapshots), Log Storage (event logs), and Custom Storage — with support for replicated grain instances across clusters.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Cluster Management

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Silo Clustering" icon="puzzle">
    Automatic cluster membership, failure detection, and silo discovery using pluggable providers (Azure Table, Redis, SQL, Consul, ZooKeeper, and more).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Directory" icon="document">
    A distributed directory that maps grain identities to their physical locations in the cluster, enabling transparent location-aware routing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Heterogeneous Silos" icon="setting">
    Run different grain types on different silos within the same cluster, allowing you to tailor hardware and resources to specific workloads.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Migration" icon="right-arrow">
    Migrate grains between silos without losing state via dehydration and rehydration. Grains implement `IGrainMigrationParticipant` to participate in the migration process.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Reliability & Transactions

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="ACID Transactions" icon="pencil">
    Coordinate multi-grain operations with distributed ACID transactions — ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability across grains and storage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reentrancy & Request Scheduling" icon="random">
    Fine-grained control over concurrency with `[Reentrant]`, `[AlwaysInterleave]`, `[ReadOnly]`, and `[MayInterleave]` attributes. Call chain reentrancy scopes for advanced scenarios.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Load Shedding" icon="setting">
    Automatically reject new requests when a silo is overloaded, protecting the cluster from cascading failure. Memory-based activation shedding deactivates least-recently-used grains under pressure.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Versioning & Deployment

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Grain Interface Versioning" icon="setting">
    Version grain interfaces for rolling upgrades and staged deployments. The cluster maintains compatibility mappings and automatically redirects requests to compatible activations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kubernetes Hosting" icon="puzzle">
    Deploy Orleans clusters on Kubernetes with dedicated hosting that reads pod labels, detects dead silos, and cleans up membership automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Cluster / Geo-Distribution" icon="random">
    Federate multiple Orleans clusters into a loosely connected multi-cluster for geo-distribution across data centers. Clusters run autonomously even if others fail.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Serialization & Code Generation

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Serialization Framework" icon="seti:json">
    High-performance, version-tolerant serialization using `[GenerateSerializer]` and `[Id(n)]` attributes. Faithfully represents .NET generics, polymorphism, object identity, and cyclic graphs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code Generation (Source Generators)" icon="setting">
    Build-time C# source generators produce grain references, method dispatching, exception propagation, and serializer code — no runtime code generation required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Immutability Optimization" icon="rocket">
    Use `Immutable<T>` or `[Immutable]` to skip deep-copying of method arguments for types known to be immutable, reducing serialization overhead.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Interceptors & Cross-Cutting Concerns

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Grain Call Filters" icon="random">
    Intercept incoming and outgoing grain calls with `IIncomingGrainCallFilter` and `IOutgoingGrainCallFilter` for authorization, logging, telemetry, and error handling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Services" icon="puzzle">
    Special grains that run on every silo from startup to shutdown with no stable identity. Used to distribute infrastructure responsibility across the cluster — reminders are implemented this way.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Observability

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry)" icon="open-book">
    Full distributed tracing support for grain calls, timer callbacks, and streaming operations. Enable via `AddActivityPropagation` and integrate with any OpenTelemetry exporter.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metrics & Monitoring" icon="document">
    Exposes metrics via `System.Diagnostics.Metrics` with a `"Microsoft.Orleans"` meter covering runtime statistics, reminders, storage, streams, and transactions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Orleans Dashboard" icon="setting">
    Built-in web-based monitoring tool providing real-time visibility into cluster health, silo status, grain activations, method call latency, and live log streaming.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Integration & Extensibility

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="ASP.NET Core Co-Hosting" icon="puzzle">
    Host Orleans silos alongside ASP.NET Core applications in a single process, sharing the same dependency injection container and configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title=".NET Aspire Integration" icon="rocket">
    First-class Aspire resource support with automatic ClusterId, ServiceId, endpoint configuration, service discovery, health checks, and multi-replica scaling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pluggable Providers" icon="setting">
    Swap storage, clustering, streaming, reminders, and grain directory backends without changing application code. See the full list of [available integrations](/integrations/).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grain Placement Strategies" icon="random">
    Control where grains are activated in the cluster — random, local, hash-based, resource-optimized, or implement your own custom placement strategy.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Testing

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Unit Testing (TestCluster)" icon="open-book">
    `Microsoft.Orleans.TestingHost` provides `TestCluster` for spinning up in-memory clusters in integration tests. Mock `IGrainFactory` for isolated unit testing without a running cluster.
  </Card>
