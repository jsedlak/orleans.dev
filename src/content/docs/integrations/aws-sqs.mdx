description: Use Amazon Simple Queue Service as a streaming provider for Orleans.

import { Card, CardGrid, Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service on AWS. The Orleans SQS stream provider uses SQS queues to transport stream events between producers and consumers.

## Capabilities

| Feature | Package |
|---|---|
| Streaming | `Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.SQS` |

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.SQS
```

## Configuration

### Silo

```csharp
siloBuilder.AddSqsStreams("SQSProvider", configurator =>
{
    configurator.ConfigureSqs(options =>
    {
        options.Service = "us-east-1";
    });
});

// Required: PubSub store for subscription metadata
siloBuilder.AddDynamoDBGrainStorage("PubSubStore", options =>
{
    options.Service = "us-east-1";
});
```

### Client

```csharp
clientBuilder.AddSqsStreams("SQSProvider", configurator =>
{
    configurator.ConfigureSqs(options =>
    {
        options.Service = "us-east-1";
    });
});
```

## How It Works

The SQS stream provider creates a set of SQS queues that Orleans uses to transport events. Pulling agents running inside silos poll these queues and deliver messages to the appropriate stream consumers.

Key characteristics:

- **At-least-once delivery** — SQS guarantees each message is delivered at least once. Consumers should be idempotent.
- **No strict FIFO** — Standard SQS queues provide best-effort ordering. Use this provider when strict ordering is not required.
- **Automatic scaling** — SQS handles throughput scaling transparently.

<Aside>
  SQS streams provide at-least-once delivery without strict ordering guarantees. For ordered, replayable streams on AWS, consider combining with a Kafka-compatible service like Amazon MSK and the [Apache Kafka](/integrations/apache-kafka/) provider.
</Aside>

## Authentication

The SQS provider uses the AWS SDK credential resolution chain, the same as the [DynamoDB provider](/integrations/aws-dynamodb/). Use IAM roles in production.

```csharp
// On EC2, ECS, or Lambda — credentials are provided automatically
configurator.ConfigureSqs(options =>
{
    options.Service = "us-east-1";
});
```

See the [Streaming](/guides/streaming/) guide for producer and consumer patterns.
